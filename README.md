# credit-risk-ml

This project explores the use of supervised machine learning techniques to estimate borrower default probabilities using structured financial data.

The case study is based on a publicly available consumer lending dataset inspired by Home Credit, a financial services provider focused on expanding access to credit.

The objective is to:

Build a structured predictive modeling pipeline

Compare model performance across specifications

Evaluate trade-offs between interpretability and predictive accuracy

Implement disciplined validation to reduce overfitting

This project focuses on methodological rigor rather than real-world deployment.
